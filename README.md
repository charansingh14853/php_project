Product Management Web Application
Overview
This project is a PHP-based web application that allows users to manage product data dynamically. Users can add new products through a form, and the submitted data is stored in a JSON file. The application displays the data in a table, calculates total values, and dynamically updates the table using AJAX.

Features
1. Product Submission Form
The form collects product details:
Product Name
Quantity in Stock
Price per Item
Input validation ensures that required fields are filled.
2. Dynamic Data Storage
All submitted product data is saved in a data.json file in valid JSON format.
3. Interactive Table
Displays the following details for each product:
Product Name
Quantity in Stock
Price per Item
Datetime Submitted
Total Value (calculated as Quantity * Price).
Includes a Sum Total row showing the total of all "Total Value" numbers.
4. AJAX Integration
Form submission and table updates happen without refreshing the page, ensuring a smooth user experience.
5. Responsive Design
Styled with Twitter Bootstrap, the application works seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
PHP: Backend server-side scripting for handling form submissions and data processing.
JSON: Data storage format for product records.
JavaScript/jQuery: For AJAX and dynamic content updates.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive and visually appealing design.
HTML/CSS: Structure and custom styling.
How It Works
Submission Process:

The user fills in the product details in the form and submits it.
Data is sent via AJAX to submit.php, which saves it in data.json.
Fetching Data:

The webpage fetches data from fetch.php using AJAX and populates the table dynamically.
Table Calculation:

Each productâ€™s total value (Quantity * Price) is calculated.
The sum total of all "Total Value" numbers is displayed in the last row.
Data Management:

All data persists in the data.json file.
